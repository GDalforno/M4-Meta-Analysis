# Investigating the Application of Machine Learning to Forecast Industrial Univariate Time Series using Meta Learning

The repository contains the code to build a model recomendation system to recomend between machine learning and statistical approaches to forecast industrial univariate time series from the M4 competition based on meta learning principles. The properties of the meta-learner predictions were studied in order to get conclusions about the choice of modelling a time series using a machine learning model like a neural network instead of a classical ARIMA or ETS model.
